# Purpose

This project was assigned to me with a broad scope as the capstone of my MSBA program at Cornell University. I was instructed to produce a value prop for Instacart utilizing the data found in this Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data.
We were instructed to take a unique angle at utilizing this dataset that is distinct from the original Kaggle problem it stems from.
